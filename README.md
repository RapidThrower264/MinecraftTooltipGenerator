# Minecraft Tooltip Generator
![Minecraft Tooltip Generator Banner](images/readme/banner-large.png)

**Hello**, **greetings** or **Good Morning**!

Creating items for Hypixel Skyblock Concepts (or Minecraft Tooltips) can be a little bit of a struggle. And there aren't many web based options for generating Minecraft Tooltips... **Until now!**

This website allows you simply type in the text for an item, and it will automatically render a Minecraft style tooltip out for you, ready for copying straight into your concepts or project.

This is an website that allows you to simply type in the text that you want for an item, and it will automatically render it into Minecraft style tooltip, ready for use in a concept or project. You have the ability to change the color, **boldness**, *italicize*, ~~strikethrough~~ and even <ins>underline</ins>! It uses the same font files that Minecraft uses so you get that "authentic" look how how it would in game. So go crazy with using some of the more obscure Unicode characters.

![UI of the application](images/readme/ui-example.png)

Wanting to feel a little ***fancy***? You have the ability to add an item that sits next to the Tooltip. Blocks or Items? It's your choice! There are hundreds of different options to choose from. There is the ability to change the color of leather armor to whatever you need as well.

- Ability to add blocks, items or player heads that sit next to the generated tooltip.
    - Player heads can come from a file upload, Base64 string or a link.

## Future For the Project
I haven't really thought of where this might end up. Mainly just using it as an excuse to make a project for my coding portfolio. I have a couple more extra features that I would love to incorporate, but getting to this point has been a bit of a struggle.

Feel free to leave an "Issue" on the GitHub page with any ideas for improvements or bug fixes. I'll eventually take a look at it and make changes.

## After Thoughts
Normally something important would go here.\
But I have nothing. 

Good luck with whatever you end up making with this!\
Hopefully it inspires some change in Skyblock.
